#Book Library Project
In this project, I made a library program which is a php MySQL and java based computer program during my internship. 
I completed Java coding and program design over Netbeans. In this program, we can edit, delete and add our books and see them as a list in the library table on the right, 
as id, book title, author, genre and publisher. From the search bar, we can find the desired book from our list and see the number of books in our library.
